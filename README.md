# 🚀 Getting Started

## Prerequisites

Make sure the following are installed:

- Node.js (v18 or later)
- npm
- MongoDB Community Server
- Git
- Visual Studio Code (Recommended)

Check your installation:

```bash
node -v
npm -v
git --version
```

---

## 1️⃣ Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jeyakiruthikad/Odoo-Hackathon.git

cd Odoo-Hackathon
```

---

## 2️⃣ Backend Setup

Navigate to the backend folder:

```bash
cd transitops-backend
```

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

### Create a `.env` file

```env
PORT=5000
MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
JWT_SECRET=your_secret_key
```

> Replace the placeholder values with your own local configuration. Do not commit your actual `.env` file to GitHub.

Start the backend server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

You should see:

```
MongoDB Connected
Server running on port 5000
```

---

## 3️⃣ Frontend Setup

Open a new terminal.

Navigate to the frontend folder:

```bash
cd transitops-frontend
```

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

### Create a `.env` file

```env
VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:5000/api
```

Start the frontend:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open your browser and visit:

```
http://localhost:5173
```

---

## 4️⃣ Running the Application

Start both servers.

### Backend

```bash
cd transitops-backend
npm run dev
```

### Frontend

```bash
cd transitops-frontend
npm run dev
```

The application will be available at:

```
http://localhost:5173
```
